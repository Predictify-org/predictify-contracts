# Recommendations of Security and Best Practices

## Code Practices
- Use OWASP Application Security Verification Standard(ASVS) for the verification of security controls
- Implement servers and frameworks are running on latest versions.
- Encrypt highly sensitive information(authentication verification data)

## Infrastucture
- Monitor networks and update software and hardware regularly

- Use auto-scanning tools like Synk

## Access Control
- Principle of Least Priviledge(PoLP) ensures authorized users can execute jobs within the system.
